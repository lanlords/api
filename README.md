# SteamCMD API

Read-only API interface for steamcmd app_info

### Container Image

The API is run via a Docker image which contains both the `steamcmd` binary and
the Python code which is wrapped around it. You can build and run the container
(locally) with Docker:
```
docker build -t steamcmd-api:test .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d steamcmd-api:test
```
However during development, using Docker Compose is preferred.
See the [Development](#development) section for information.

### Deploying

Newer versions of the API are automatically deployed on Heroku when a new version
has been created on Github. Deployment is done via [Github Actions](https://github.com/steamcmd/api/actions)

If you want or need to deploy manually you will have to authenticate locally:
```
heroku container:login
```
And use the following deployment commands:
```
heroku container:push web --app yourappname
heroku container:release web --app yourappname
```

### Development

The easiest way to spin up the development environment is using Docker compose.
This will build the image locally, mount the correct directory (`src`) and set
the required environment variables. If you are on windows you should store the 
repository in the WSL filesystem or it will fail. Execute compose up in the root:
```
docker-compose up
```
Now you can reach the SteamCMD API locally on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To keep things simple, [Black](https://github.com/python/black) is used for code style / formatting. Part of the pipeline
will check if the code is properly formatted according to Black code style. You can install it locally via pip:
```
pip install black
```
And then simply run it agains the Python source code:
```
black src
```
